* HuggingFace Spaces allow you to publish Streamlit Apps.
* The Free Tier hardware is "CPU basic 2vCPU 16GB"

This Free Tier hardware configuration is enough to publish a standard Streamlit dashboard. But, publishing a LLM Powered Streamlit Dashboard with this Free hardware config on HuggingFace Spaces maybe a challenge.

This repo tries to solve for this problem by - 
1. Providing Boilerplate Code to create a Streamlit App
2. Open Source, lightweight LLM models that could be used to integrate in the Streamlit App
